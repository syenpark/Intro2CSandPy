### __Week 1: Python Basics__
#### Concepts and Terminologies
- An Algorithm VS. A Program
- Computational Mode of Thinking
- Every computers can do perform calculations and remember the results.
- Declarative Knowledge VS. Imperative Knowledge
- A Stored Program Computer VS. A Fixed Program Computer
- A Program Counter
- Syntax VS. Static semantics VS. Semantics
#### [Problem Set 1](https://github.com/syenpark/Intro2CSandPy/tree/master/Week1/problem_set1)
- Problem 2: The number of times a substring occurs in a string
- Problem 3: Longest substring in alphabetical order
	*What I learnt; 
	Python style guide to accumulate a string*

### __Week 2: Simple Algorithms__
#### Concepts and Terminologies
- Computer machine is a binary system, so..
 Not every *number* can be stored exactly in a computer machine because a computer machine uses only binary digits. 

> If there is no integer p such that x*(2**p) is a whole number, then internal representation is always an approximation

- Exhaustive unumeration
- Bisection Search
	
	*What I learnt; 
	[Bisection Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method) VS. Binary Search* 
- Newton-Raphson
- Recursion
Some problems are solved intuitivey and concisely with a recursion approach such as Tower of Hanoi. In a technical interview, it is one of common questions to convert interation loops to recursion for interviewees, and vice versa. However, iteration loops are usually better for performance reasons.

#### Practice 4
