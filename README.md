### __Week 1: Python Basics__
#### Concepts and Terminologies
- An Algorithm VS. A Program
- Computational Mode of Thinking
- Every computers can do perform calculations and remember the results.
- Declarative Knowledge VS. Imperative Knowledge
- A Stored Program Computer VS. A Fixed Program Computer
- A Program Counter
- Syntax VS. Static semantics VS. Semantics
#### Problem Set 1
- The number of times a substring occurs in a string
- Longest substring in alphabetical order

### __Week 2: Simple Algorithms__
Not every 'Number' can be stored exactly because computer machine uses binary digits. Some are represented approximately. Here is examples of finding root to show the way machine deals with numbers.
- #### Exhaustive unumeration
  
- #### Bisection Search
	[Bisection Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method) VS. Binary Search
- #### Newton-Raphson
